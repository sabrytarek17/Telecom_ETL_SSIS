ðŸ”– Notes / Best Practices

Use package configurations or environment variables for connection strings and file paths to avoid hard-coding.

Implement incremental load checks (e.g., file timestamp or processed marker) to avoid duplicates.

Keep detailed logging (package execution, row counts, error messages) for easier troubleshooting.

Consider adding a lightweight monitoring job (SQL Agent) to trigger packages and alert on failures.
